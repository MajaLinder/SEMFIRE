# GitFlow
This repository has a protected main branch, with the latest stable version. We will use topic branches to work on during increments. Once the team/developers on the topic are done, they will do a merge request and assign someone not involved in the development to review and the developer who issued the merge request approves it making sure that the main branch remains stable. Ideally we will be updated about teamwork during standups and we can guesstimate potential conflicts with specific teams/developers who we will aim to choose to assign for review.

The agreed syntax for branch name, commit messages and merge requests:

-   **Branch name:** < short description of feature/topic >
-   **Commits:** #< nr of issue on board > < short descriptive message > {co-authors}
-   **Merge requests:** #< nr of issue on board > < descriptive message > The merge request shall explain the implementation, with pictures as a complementation if necessary.
