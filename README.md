This repository has a protected main branch, with the latest stable version. We will use topic branches to work on during increments. Once the team/developers on the topic are done, they will do a merge request and assign someone not involved in the development to review and approve the merge request. Ideally we will be updated about teamwork during standups and we can guesstimate potential conflicts with specific teams- which we will assign for review.
